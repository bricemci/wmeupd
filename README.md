## How To Use

Launch **INSTALL.BAT** from within the **Updates** folder and follow the on-screen instructions.

Your computer will restart several times during installation. After each restart, the installer will relaunch and resume installing updates until the installation process is complete. (If the installer does not automatically resume, launch INSTALL.BAT again to continue installing updates.) 

Some updates require additional information during installation so they can configure your computer accordingly. Read any information carefully as it is being presented to you, and choose any options you wish to install.

After the installation process has completed, it is recommended that you check the **Components** folder for any optional Windows components that may be needed for your system. These components offer additional functionality in Windows and may be needed by applications you intend to use (such as DirectX, which is essential for running many popular games).

It is recommended that you also review the **Patches** folder, which contains a selection of third-party patches that address common issues with Windows Me and its applications, and provide support for hardware components and configurations that are newer than Windows Me was originally designed for.
