## How To Use

Launch **INSTALL.BAT** from within the **Updates** folder and follow the on-screen instructions.

Your computer will restart several times during installation. After each restart, the installer will relaunch and resume installing updates until the installation process is complete. If the installer does not resume, launch INSTALL.BAT again to continue installing updates.

Some updates require additional information during installation so they can configure your computer accordingly. Read any information carefully as it is being presented to you, and choose any options you wish to install.

After the installation has completed, it is recommended that you check the **Components** folder to see if any optional component packages are needed for your particular system. (Such as DirectX, which is required for running many common games.)

If your computer contains hardware components or specifications newer than Windows Me was originally designed for, it is highly recommended that you also review the **Patches** folder and install any patches needed to support your hardware configuration.
