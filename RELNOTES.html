        <p>
            Release 2.3 of the Windows Me Update CD contains a number of changes and improvements, including a completely rewritten and optimised installer that offers better installation reliability, more than 40 additional updates for Windows Me and preinstalled components such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, a number of optional components that extend the functionality of Windows, and new optional patches to fix issues and improve the performance and stability of your Windows Me system.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is recommended for all new installs, and can now be installed as an upgrade on systems that have been updated with earlier releases of the Windows Me Update CD.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Installer Changes</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now automatically determines which version of Internet Explorer is installed and installs the correct updates for each version (5.5 or 6.0). Additionally, if the user wishes to upgrade from Internet Explorer 5.5 to 6.0 during the installation process, they can choose to do so.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now automatically determines which version of Windows Media Player is installed and installs the correct updates for each version (7.0 / 7.1 or 9.0). Additionally, if the user wishes to upgrade from Windows Media Player 7 to 9 during the installation process, they can choose to do so.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now automatically determines if the Windows NetMeeting component is already installed and installs the latest updates for NetMeeting if so.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now temporarily enables automatic logon while installing updates, removing the need to dismiss the Windows logon prompt with each restart.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now determines if the updates are being installed from a drive other than the boot drive (such as a CD-ROM or USB device) and pre-copies the installation packages to the TEMP folder if so. This improves reliability during installation and reduces the likelihood of encountering errors as a result of missing or inaccessible files.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now temporarily suspends the PC State Manager (STATEMGR.EXE) service during installation, preventing System File Protection from incorrectly reverting installed files to their earlier versions, even when a valid security catalog is registered. The PC State Manager is re-enabled after installation has completed, returning System File Protection and System Restore functionality to normal.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now checks for sufficient temporary free hard disk space (200MB) before starting the installation, and checks for additional free space if pre-copying installation files (350MB).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer includes several switches that can be used to alter the installation process, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>/FS, skips checking for free disk space before installing.</li>
                    <li>/PR, skips pre-copying files to the hard drive before installing, and installs packages from the current source volume.</li>
                    <li>/NI, skips installing updates for Internet Explorer.</li>
                    <li>/NM, skips installing updates for Windows NetMeeting.</li>
                    <li>/NP, skips installing updates for Windows Media Player.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player are integral components of Windows Me, and a number of essential Windows stability and security fixes are dependent on these components being updated during the installation process. It is recommended that you only disable the installation of updates for Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player in very specific circumstances.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The installer now follows a standard naming convention for update packages, consisting of the title of the Knowledge Base or TechNet article associated with the update, followed by the Knowledge Base article number and/or TechNet article number where applicable.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The preinstallation fix for systems that lack the C:\WINDOWS and C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND directories in their PATH environment variable now permanently corrects the issue on affected systems by updating the corresponding values in the Windows registry.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Significantly optimised the installer to reduce the likelihood of encountering "Out of Environment Space" errors during installation.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Update Changes</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Individually reviewed more than 6,000 Microsoft Knowledge Base and TechNet articles to find additional updates for inclusion, document additional information for existing updates, and note down any potential installation or compatibility issues.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Added "Device Manager Reports Code 10 for Device and Does Not Assign an Available IRQ" (276602). This newer update replaces the earlier update "Windows Me Hangs When You Try to Enter Standby Mode with Multiple MS-DOS Prompt Sessions Running" (285882).

            </li>

                <p>
                    Added "Internet Explorer Navigation Sound Update" (319303). This update replaces C:\WINDOWS\MEDIA\START.WAV with an uncompressed version to avoid audio decompression issues when navigating between pages in Internet Explorer and between folders in Windows Explorer.

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When installing Windows Media Player 9, the installer first installs updates for Windows Media Player 6.4 and 7.1. The Windows Media Player 7.1 update also contains the latest versions of files for Windows Media Player 6.4. This ensures that earlier Windows Media components, such as codecs for Windows Media Player 6.4 and Media Player controls embedded in web browsers, are also updated to their latest versions. (Windows Media Player 6.4 is included with Windows Me and remains installed alongside newer versions of Windows Media Player.)

                    The CD now includes expanded documentation, including detailed overviews of all components and patches, information about each update included in the automatic installer, and useful information for setting up a new Windows Me system.

        <p>
            <strong>Fixed Issues</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When installing Windows Media Player or Internet Explorer, sometimes the computer would not automatically restart after the setup wizard had closed, especially if the wizard did find any files that required updating. The installer now assumes control of the restart operation following the Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer updates, preventing this issue from occurring.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Resolved an issue where some updated system files are rolled back to earlier versions by System File Protection after installation has completed, causing errors to be reported in QFECheck and potentially causing problems on some systems. The installer now suspends System File Protection for the duration of the installation process and re-enables it when installation has completed (if it was enabled prior to starting installation).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Resolved an issue where the installer may fail on systems where the TEMP environment variable is not set, is set to an incorrect directory path, or if the specified TEMP folder is not writable.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Addressed an issue where sometimes Windows would be unable to locate extracted files from certain update packages. Updates now extract with their default IXP***.TMP directory names during installation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Addressed an issue where the update "Unchecked Buffer in Universal Plug and Play Can Lead to System Compromise for Windows Me (MS01-059)" (314757) would be unable to register UPNP.DLL after restarting, causing instability and unusual behaviours (such as an inability to open Windows Explorer windows, and intermittent system lockups) on some systems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Addressed an issue where the update "Software Update for Web Folders: January 25, 2005" (892211) would not update two files included with Windows Me (FP4AUTL.DLL and FP4AWEC.DLL).
